# Webpack react build starter kit

The aim is to keep a clean, simple, highly modifiable and non-biased way of setting up a react project with react-hot-loader. Inspired by Survive.js

clone the repo and then and in your console type the following

```
$ npm i 
$ npm start
```

Head to localhost:8080 in your browser if it did not start automagically.

Feel free to submit pull requests to make it a better development friendly env.
