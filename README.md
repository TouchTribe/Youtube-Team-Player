# Webpack react build starter kit

The aim is to keep a clean, simple, highly modifiable and non-biased way of setting up a react project with react-hot-loader. Inspired by Survive.js

clone the repo and then and in your console type the following

```
$ brew install rethinkdb
$ npm i
$ npm start
$ rethinkdb --http-port 8000
$ npm run serve
```

Head to localhost:8080 in your browser if it did not start automagically.

Feel free to submit pull requests to make it a better development friendly env.

## Generating Components

To get a new component use `plop`.
Make sure it's installed on your system

```bash
[sudo] npm i plop -g
```

Then you can use it like this:

```bash
plop component
# or to get a list
plop
```
